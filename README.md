# Pythagoras

Planet-scale distributed computing in Python.

**!!! RESEARCH PREVIEW !!!**

## What is it?

Pythagoras is a super-scalable, easy-to-use, and
low-maintenance framework for (1) massive algorithm parallelization and 
(2) hardware usage optimization in Python. It simplifies and speeds up 
data science, machine learning, and AI workflows.

Pythagoras excels at complex, long-running, resource-demanding computations. 
It’s not recommended for real-time, latency-sensitive workflows.

## Usage

Pythagoras elevates two popular techniques — memoization and parallelization — 
to a global scale and then fuses them, unlocking performance and scalability 
that were previously out of reach.

## About The Name

Pythagoras of Samos was a famous ancient Greek thinker and scientist 
who was the first man to call himself a philosopher ("lover of wisdom"). 
He is most recognised for his many mathematical findings, 
including the Pythagorean theorem. 

Not everyone knows that in antiquity, Pythagoras was also credited with 
major astronomical discoveries, such as sphericity of the Earth 
and the identity of the morning and evening stars as the planet Venus.
