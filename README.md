# Pythagoras

Planet-scale distributed computing in Python.

**!!! RESEARCH PREVIEW !!!**

## What is it?

`Pythagoras` is a super-scalable, low-maintenance framework for 
massive algorithm parallelization in Python. It simplifies and accelerates 
data science, machine learning, and AI workflows.

Pythagoras offers:

* seamless parallel execution of Python code, locally or 
in heterogeneous distributed environments of virtually any scale;
* ubiquitous caching for intermediate program states, 
with intelligent data and code change tracking;
* simple and budget-friendly orchestration backend.

Pythagoras excels at optimizing complex, long-running,
resource-demanding computations. It’s not the best choice for real-time,
latency-sensitive workflows.

## Usage

Pythagoras elevates two popular techniques — memoization and parallelization — 
to a global scale and then fuses them, unlocking performance and scalability 
that were previously out of reach.

## About The Name

Pythagoras of Samos was a famous ancient Greek thinker and scientist 
who was the first man to call himself a philosopher ("lover of wisdom"). 
He is most recognised for his many mathematical findings, 
including the Pythagorean theorem. 

Not everyone knows that in antiquity, Pythagoras was also credited with 
major astronomical discoveries, such as sphericity of the Earth 
and the identity of the morning and evening stars as the planet Venus.
