"""Basic pre-validation utilities for protected code portals.

This module contains small, composable validators used by protected portals
before executing user functions. Each public factory returns a
SimplePreValidatorFn configured with fixed arguments, so validators can be
attached declaratively to protected functions.

Execution context:
- When executed by a portal, validator functions run with two names injected
  into their global namespace: `self` (the ValidatorFn instance) and `pth`
  (the pythagoras package). This allows them to access portal services such as
  system introspection and package management.

Conventions:
- Return ValidationSuccessFlag (VALIDATION_SUCCESSFUL) to indicate the check
  passed; return None to indicate the check did not pass.
