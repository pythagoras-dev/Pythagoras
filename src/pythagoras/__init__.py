"""Distributed serverless compute at a global scale.

Pythagoras is a framework for distributed computations in Python.

It offers 3 main advantages:

- Global scale: parallelize your algorithms to scale to millions of nodes.
- Low maintenance: no need to manage servers and infrastructure,
Pythagoras replaces expensive compute with cheap storage.
- High performance: 'compute once, reuse forever' strategy
significanty accelerates long-running workflows.

Pythagoras is able to offer these benefits as it's the first framework
to fully implement the Functional Programming 2.0 paradigm.

Pythagoras excels at optimizing complex, long-running,
resource-demanding computations. Itâ€™s not the best choice for real-time,
latency-sensitive workflows.
