"""Signatures and conversion utilities.

This subpackage provides helpers for generating stable identifiers and
converting between common textual/byte representations used across
Pythagoras. It re-exports frequently used helpers for convenience.

The modules exposed here are intentionally lightweight and side-effect free
so they can be used in hashing and address computations.

Exports:
  base_16_32_convertors: Base-16/32 encoding and decoding helpers.
  current_date_gmt_str: Utilities to format current date/time in GMT.
  hash_signatures: Functions to compute content hash/signature strings.
  node_signature: Functions to derive signatures for the current node.
  random_signatures: Helpers to generate random, collision-resistant IDs.
